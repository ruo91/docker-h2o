        # https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/access_log_directives.html#access-log
        access-log:
          path: /etc/h2o/logs/localhost-access.log
          # Custom
          #format: "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"

        # Sets the upstream I/O timeout in milliseconds.

        # proxy timeout keepalive (global, host, path)
        # https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/proxy_directives.html#proxy.timeout.keepalive
        # Sets the upstream timeout for idle connections in milliseconds.

        ### Reproxy Directives ###
        # reproxy (path)
        # A boolean flag (ON or OFF) indicating if the server should recognize the X-Reproxy-URL header sent from upstream servers.
        # If H2O recognizes the header, it fetches the contents of the resource specified by the header, and sends the contents as the response to the client.
        # For example, an upstream server may send an URL pointing to a large image using the X-Reproxy-URL header stored on a distributed file system,
        # and let H2O fetch and return the content to the client, instead of fetching the image by itself. Doing so would reduce the load on the application server.
        reproxy: OFF

# redirect.localhost
hosts:
  "redirect.localhost":
    paths:
      "/":
        ### Redirect Directives ###
        # redirect (path)
        # https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/redirect_directives.html#redirect
        # Redirects the requests to given URL.
        # If the argument is a scalar, the value is considered as the URL to where the requests should be redirected.
        # If the argument is a mapping, the url property is considered the URL, and the status property indicates the status code to be used for the redirect response.
        # The directive rewrites the URL by replacing the host and path part of the URL at which the directive is used with the given URL.
        # For example, when using the configuration below, requests to http://example.com/abc.html will be redirected to https://example.com/abc.html.
        redirect:
          status: 301
          url: "http://localhost/"
